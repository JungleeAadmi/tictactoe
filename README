Tic Tac Toe
“Just a harmless timepass made entirely by AI — no humans were allowed near the keyboard.”
A minimalist, iOS‑style liquid glass tic‑tac‑toe. X starts, turns alternate, and a silky modal declares the winner or a draw.

Features
Glassmorphism UI with smooth hover and click feedback.

X always starts; strict alternation; win and draw detection.

iOS‑ish modal popup with “Play Again.”
